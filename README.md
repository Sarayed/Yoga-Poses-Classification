## Introduction

Yoga is a practice that involves physical postures or poses, and automatic classification of these poses can be valuable for various applications, including fitness tracking and virtual yoga instructors. This project employs CNN, a powerful deep learning architecture, for the classification of yoga poses based on input images.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create a model that can accurately classify images of individuals performing different yoga poses. The model should be capable of distinguishing between various poses, providing a foundation for automated yoga pose recognition.


### Model Architecture

The CNN architecture is designed to capture spatial hierarchies and features in yoga pose images. It consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

### Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the testing dataset. Training metrics, such as accuracy and loss, are monitored to ensure the model's effectiveness.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset, demonstrating its capability to accurately classify yoga poses. The results are presented in terms of classification accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of CNN for yoga pose classification. The trained model can be a valuable tool for yoga enthusiasts, fitness applications, or anyone interested in automated pose recognition.
